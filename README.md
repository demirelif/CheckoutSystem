## Features

### Checkout
Using the checkout system, you can scan items, cancel a scan, and calculate the total. 
In order to scan an item use the following code. 
```bash
Checkout checkout = new Checkout( priceList );
checkout.scan("A");
```
And you can cancel the scan with the following.
```bash
checkout.cancelScan("A");
```
Here, you only need to name of the item, or a simple char. Checkout system automatically matches this string with its database. 
For instance, let's assume we have the following price list. Char A corresponds to the Item A. 
```bash
Item    Unit Price    Special Price
-------------------------------------
A       80             3 for 220
B       35             2 for 55
C       20
D       10
```
In this case, the system adds one from Item A to the cart. 
### PriceList
The table given before represents the PriceList. Here, you can define pricing rules including regular prices and discounted prices. 
```bash
PriceList priceList = new PriceList();
priceList.addItem( new Item("A", 80.0));
```
You can also define SpecialPrices for n amount of items as follows. 
```bash
SpecialOffer specialOffer = new SpecialOffer( 3, 220);
```
To assign any special price to any item, simply use the following method. 
```bash
priceList.addSpecialOfferToItem( "A", specialOffer );
```
You can add multiple special offers for an item. The checkout system will apply the deals from most to least in terms of number of items.
